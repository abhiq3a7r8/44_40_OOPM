## Implementing Many-to-Many Relationship in Java

The provided Java code demonstrates the implementation of a many-to-many relationship between customers, electronic devices, and brands. It simulates a basic electronic device purchasing system using arrays of objects. The program initializes customer, electronic device, brand, and purchase objects, establishes relationships among them, and displays the purchase details.

## Customer Objects
- Five customer objects are created with names, IDs, and phone numbers.

## Electronic Device Objects
- Five electronic device objects are created with names and prices.

## Brand Objects
- Five brand objects are created with brand names.

## Purchase Objects
- Ten purchase objects are created and initialized.
- Each purchase object establishes connections between electronic devices, customers, and brands, implementing a many-to-many relationship.

## Program Execution
1. Customer names, IDs, and phone numbers are set.
2. Electronic device names and prices are set.
3. Brand names are set.
4. Purchase transactions are simulated, creating connections between devices, customers, and brands.
5. Purchase details for each transaction are displayed, showcasing the many-to-many relationships.

The code exemplifies object-oriented programming concepts and demonstrates the implementation of a many-to-many relationship in the context of a simple electronic device purchasing system.
