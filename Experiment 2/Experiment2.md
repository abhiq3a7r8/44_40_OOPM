# Menu-driven many to many relation between two classes

This Java program is designed to manage customer data, electronic devices, and their purchases. It uses arrays to store and manipulate objects of different classes, including `Customer`, `Electronic_Device`, `Brand`, and `purchases`. The program presents a menu-driven interface where users can perform various actions such as adding customers, displaying customer details, adding electronic devices, displaying device details, making purchases, and displaying purchase records.

## Key Concepts

- The program utilizes the concept of object-oriented programming.
- It demonstrates dynamic object creation using arrays.
- The program includes classes for `Customer`, `Electronic_Device`, `Brand`, and `purchases`.
- The main class `Main` contains a menu-driven interface for user interactions.
- Users can add customers, electronic devices, and purchases, as well as display relevant information.

## Array Usage

- `Customer` instances are stored in an array `cust_array`.
- `Electronic_Device` instances are stored in an array `device_array`.
- `Brand` instances are stored in an array `brand_array`.
- `purchases` instances are stored in an array `purchases_array`.

## Menu Options

1. **Add a new Customer**: Allows adding customer details to the `cust_array`.
2. **Display a Customer**: Displays details of a specific customer.
3. **Add a new Electronic_Device**: Allows adding electronic device details to the `device_array`.
4. **Display a Electronic_Device**: Displays details of a specific electronic device.
5. **Add a Purchase**: Records purchases with details of the customer and device.
6. **Display all Purchases**: Displays details of all recorded purchases.
7. **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Usage

1. Users can input information for customers and electronic devices.
2. Users can create purchase records associating customers with purchased electronic devices.
3. The program displays relevant information based on user choices.

**Note**: The program uses a menu interface and arrays to demonstrate basic management functionalities. Improvements could include error handling, data validation, and more advanced data storage solutions.
